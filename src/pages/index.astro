        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>
          Vilye Farmer Producer Company Limited is a newly registered Farmer
          Producer Company founded with a simple yet powerful goal‚Äîto empower
          farmers through collective strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, we are a growing group of like-minded
          farmers who have come together to build something bigger than
          ourselves. We believe that when farmers collaborate, share resources,
          and act as one, they unlock new opportunities‚Äîfrom better prices and
          inputs to stronger market access and local value addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though we've just started our journey, our roots run deep in the soil
          we cultivate, and our dreams are as vast as the fields we farm.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          In February 2025, a small group of farmers in Vilye, Ratnagiri,
          Maharashtra decided it was time for a change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tired of working in isolation and facing unpredictable markets, we
          came together to register Vilye Farmer Producer Company under the
          Companies Act as a formal Producer Company. Our collective is built on
          trust, shared values, and a vision of a more secure and prosperous
          farming future.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't just an organization‚Äîit's a movement. A movement toward
          better prices, modern methods, and local empowerment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are just getting started, but we are already focused on building
          systems, partnerships, and infrastructure that will support farmers
          not just today, but for generations to come.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
          To create a thriving, farmer-led ecosystem where agriculture is not
          only sustainable, but profitable, innovative, and respected.
        </p>

        <h3>What We're Working On</h3>
        <p>
          As a newly launched FPC, here are the areas we're actively building:
          <ul>

          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We know we won't build everything overnight‚Äîbut with consistency,
          transparency, and shared effort, we believe we can build something
          lasting.
        </p>

        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>
          We're just a few months in, but the energy is real and the purpose is
          clear. We're seeking partnerships‚Äîwith other FPCs, NGOs, agri-tech
          providers, and government bodies‚Äîto scale our efforts.
        </p>
